# QR-Camera
This project is setup by UC Leuven-Limburg at Limburg, Diepenbeek. 
In colloberation with ACRO in echnology centrum Diepenbeek. 
I was tasked as my bachelor test to make a simple camera system to operate on a simple self driving car.
The car drives around a apple farm, The car has a pre-set road it will follow along a track. 
The apple pluckers will set up these crates with QR code's when A crate is full they uncover the QR code.
Bye doing so, the car can then reconize the crate. when reconized the car whill bring in the crate in his loading system. 
Then bring it to an pre-set location. make sure not hurting other crate's or humans/animals.
